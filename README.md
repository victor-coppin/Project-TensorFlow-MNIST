# TensorFlow GPU Environment Verification for MNIST
A simple project to verify a GPU-accelerated TensorFlow environment by training a small Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the MNIST dataset.
Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to provide a definitive test script to confirm that a complex data science environment is correctly configured. Specifically, it verifies that TensorFlow can successfully leverage the parallel processing power of an NVIDIA GPU for faster model training.

This script serves as the final step after setting up:

- NVIDIA Drivers

- CUDA Toolkit

- cuDNN Library

- A dedicated Python virtual environment with tensorflow installed.
